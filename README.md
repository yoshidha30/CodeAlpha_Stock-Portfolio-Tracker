# TASK DESCRIPTION:
      This task focuses on building a simple yet powerful Stock Portfolio Tracker using core Python concepts. The goal is to help users calculate the total value of their stock investments based on fixed, manually defined stock prices.

Instead of using live stock market data from APIs, this tracker uses a hardcoded dictionary to store a few popular stock symbols and their corresponding prices — for example, {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250, "GOOGL": 140}. This keeps the project simple, offline, and fully focused on the core logic of programming.

The user is prompted to enter the stock symbols and the number of shares they own. The program validates the input, checks if the symbol is in the available stock list, and then calculates the value for each stock by multiplying the price by the quantity. It keeps adding these values to get the total investment amount, which is then displayed in a well-structured summary.

To enhance functionality, the program also includes an optional feature to save the investment summary into a .csv file. This file contains each stock’s details — symbol, quantity, price, and total value — along with the overall investment value. This is an excellent introduction to file handling in Python and prepares learners to work with real-world data formats.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to master:

Dictionaries for storing data

User input and validation

Loops and basic arithmetic

File I/O (CSV format)

Overall, the Stock Portfolio Tracker is a practical and engaging way to learn Python by simulating a real-world use case — managing and calculating investment portfolios!
